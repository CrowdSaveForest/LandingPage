			<h2 class="text-center">Built and maintained by everyone</h2>
			<p>The idea is a platform that is built by everyone over open source. We have setup a Github page where everyone are welcome to contribute to the platform in whichever way they believe fit. We will publish a checklist with specific parts of the platform that needs to be developed but we want everyone to come with suggestions and help drive the development process, this cannot be emphasized enough.</p>

			<p>In addition to building the platform together we want the conceptual development to also be a collaboration. We suggest a starting point, and then share the concept. That means that you can suggest changes, and if the majority finds that solution better than the existing, this solution will be implemented. The concept is not an organization led and controlled by us but a platform controlled by its users.</p>

    		<p>Current organizations working against deforestation, and other causes, are slow, incur large administration fees, and are basically caught in the last century. In the last decade we have witnessed the emergence of new business models brought through IT innovations that can flip an industry on its head, for instance Uber, Airbnb, Netflix etc. We propose a platform that does something similar to the NGO industry. We want the platform to be open for everyone, free from any charges and control to be fully democratic and set by its users. That’s the vision.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center">Crowdfunding</h2>
			<p>The funding part will be different from existing solutions. Where you now can donate to a non-transparent fund, this platform will give you the opportunity to donate to specific prospects of forests. The prospects will include the geographical area, information about size, price, and a deadline for fundraising. By donating to a specific prospect, contributors know exactly where their money will go. After each purchase one suggestion is that signed accounts of the transactions are published in collaboration with an auditing partner. This would ensure full transparency and prove that all donations are directed to its rightful purpose. If a prospect fails to raise enough capital we propose that the donations are returned.</p>

			<p>With all donations going directly to a third party, such as a major bank or auditing firm, the platform could ensure that no funds ever enter the organization itself. We propose this for two reasons: 1. We believe auditing firms would be willing to facilitate this at no fee as it is a good initiative and 2. It greatly reduces the risk that some people within the organization misuses the funds. The latter has been an issue in several “non-profit” organizations. Once the platform proves successful in purchasing land we propose one opens up for donations directed towards land protection and preservation.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center">The organization</h2>
			<p>A trustee will be set up that secures that the forest will be held indefinitely. There will be no way to sell or profit of any owned land. The founders of the organization will not be the owners of the trustee, but we will create a framework where the users are the owners.</p>

    	<h2 class="text-center">Protection</h2>
			<p>When land is bought we will set up plans on how to protect it. How to protect must be tailored to each project. Protection can be done by creative incentives for locals to preserve the land we own. We all know that one major problem is simply that people do not care about property, or rules.  Engaging the community can work. In other places we can hire “forest guardians” or similar form of protection.</p>

						The problem of deforestation and climate change is too serious to leave in the hands of slow moving corporations and politicians. We are the last generation that can make a worthy impact, and we should take command of the issue and force through a solution. The setup we suggest have the potential to be fast moving, creative, efficient and free of corporate, individual and political incentives. Join us and make it happen!

					<h2>About us</h2>
					<p>
						We are a group of people dedicated to revolutionize the way to stop deforestation. The project was started out of pure frustration over the insufficient success that existing initiatives have had over the years. The most recent members joined because of shared concerns and because of the exiting challenge this project entails. We all have jobs or full time obligations so our aim is not to profit or create a means of living for ourselves in any way. We simply believe the majority of people want to fight deforestation, what is lacking is a platform that can push through a real collaborative impact. We want to establish this for free together with likeminded to create a powerful platform for change

					<h2>How can I help?</h2>
					<p>
						The framework suggested is at an early stage and has not been constructed yet. We therefore need your help wherever you think YOU can contribute the most to the project. Admins will be selected on a running basis and responsibility will be given based on contribution to the cause. We want a fast moving organization where people can join fast and make an impact fast. If you have suggestions on improvements of the framework itself this information is also very much appreciated.

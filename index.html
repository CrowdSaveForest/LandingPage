					<p><strong>The problem of deforestation</strong> and climate change is too serious to leave in the hands of slow moving corporations and politicians. Since we are the last generation that can make a worthy impact, we should take control of the issue and force through a solution.</p>

					<div class="icon icon-fancy-br"></div>

					<p><strong>We are a group of people</strong> dedicated to revolutionize the way to stop deforestation. Our backgrounds are from IT consultancy, Finance and Management Consulting, and we all hold master’s degrees in various fields. Most of us are in the mid 20s and we are located in Copenhagen and Oslo. The project was started out of pure frustration over the insufficient success that existing initiatives have had over the years.</p>

					<div class="icon icon-fancy-br"></div>

					<p><strong>The concept we propose</strong> has the potential to be swift, flexible, efficient, and free of corporate, individual, and political incentives. We want to establish this concept for free together with likeminded to create a powerful platform for change.<p>

				<h2 class="text-center">The Concept</h2>
				<div class="icon icon-fancy-br"></div>

				<p>Current organizations working against deforestation, and other causes, are too slow abd incur large administration fees.They are stuck in the last century. In the last decade we have witnessed the emergence of new business models brought through IT innovations.</p>

				<p>We propose a platform that does something similar to the NGO industry. We want the platform to be open for everyone, free from any charges and control to be fully democratic and set by its users. That’s the vision.</p>

				<p class="text-center">We want to accomplish this by implementing:</p>

				<ul class="text-center">
					<li class="list-number text-center">1</li>
					<li>An environment where everyone can contribute on the same terms.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">2</li>
					<li>Users upload prospects of forest and users control that these prospects are in fact for real. This requires high focus to avoid scams.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">3</li>
					<li>Donators can choose to donate to specific prospects and not to a non-transparent fund. If we are not able to buy the forest, money will be returned.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">4</li>
					<li>Donations never go through the organization but through a 3rd party such as major law firms, banks, revisioning firms to facilitate the transactions from user base to the seller of land. This will ensure all funds are far away from anyone in the organization, and will therefore make any kind of profit impossible.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">5</li>
					<li>Protection of land will also be a part. This is something we are looking into.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">6</li>
					<li>When land is bought we want to create a legal framework that makes it impossible to sell it in the future so that the organization can never be turned into a profit organization.</li>

					<li class="list-number text-center">7</li>
					<li>We want the development and maintenance of the platform to be democratic with no one person or group having control. How do we ensure this?</li>

				<h2>About us</h2>
				<p>We all have jobs or full time obligations so our aim is not to profit or create a means of living for ourselves in any way. We simply believe the majority of people want to fight deforestation. However, what is lacking is a platform that can push through a real collaborative impact. We want to establish this for free together with likeminded to create a powerful platform for change.</p>

				<p><strong>The suggested concept</strong> is at an early stage and the platform has not yet been constructed. We therefore need your help in whichever way you think YOU can contribute the most to the project.</p>

				<p><strong>Admins will be selected</strong> on a running basis and responsibility will be given based on contribution to the cause. We want a fast moving organization where people can join fast and make an impact fast.</p>

				<p><strong>If you have suggestions</strong> on improvements for the framework itself this information is also very much appreciated.</p>

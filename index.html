					<p><strong>The problem of deforestation</strong> and climate change is too serious to leave in the hands of slow moving corporations and politicians. Since we are the last generation that can make a worthy impact, we should take control of the issue and force through a solution.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center">About Us and Our Vision</h2>

				<p>CrowdSaveForest is a diverse group of people dedicated to revolutionize the way to stop deforestation. Our backgrounds are from IT consultancy, Finance, and Management Consulting. We all hold master’s degrees in various fields. Most of us are in the mid 20’s and we are located in Copenhagen and Oslo. We all have jobs or full time obligations so our aim is not to profit or create a means of living for ourselves in any way. We simply believe the majority of people want to fight deforestation, what is lacking is a platform that can push through a real collaborative impact.</p>

				<p>The project was started out of pure frustration over the insufficient success that existing initiatives have had over the years. The most recent members joined because of shared concerns and because of the exciting challenge this project entails. We want to establish this concept for free together with likeminded to create a powerful platform for change. The end goal is a platform created and run by its users where 100% of donations go directly to the cause.</p>

				<h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
				<p>We basically need help with everything. The concept we propose has not been created yet so we need all the people we can get. The group is growing at the moment, but we need you on board to put this platform on the feet. We want this to be a process that is run collaboratively on volunteer work. We will never make a cent from this project, and neither will you. To start with, we especially need help with two things, spreading the word and building the platform. The technical aspect is vital as that is how we can make the collaboration effective. We have a <a href="https://github.com/CrowdSaveForest">Github account</a> where people are more than welcome to participate.</p>

				<p>
				For this project to succeed we need all kinds of people:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>People to spread the word</li>
					<li>People with large networks</li>
					<li>People with technical expertise </li>
					<li>Lawyers</li>
					<li>People with knowledge of how to buy and sell forest</li>
					<li>Social media experts</li>
					<li>Administrative help</li>
					<li>People with knowledge of how to run such projects</li>
					<li>Creative minds that think new and challenge existing solutions</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					In addition to helping with implementing the concept itself, we would appreciate input on how the concept could also be improved.

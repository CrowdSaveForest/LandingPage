						The problem of deforestation and climate change is too serious to leave in the hands of slow moving corporations and politicians. We are the last generation that can make a worthy impact, and we should take command of the issue and force through a solution.
					</p>

					<p>
						The setup we suggest have the potential to be fast moving, creative, efficient and free of corporate, individual and political incentives. Join us and make it happen!

				<h2>About us</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
				<p>We are a group of people dedicated to revolutionize the way to stop deforestation. The project was started out of pure frustration over the insufficient success that existing initiatives have had over the years. The most recent members joined because of shared concerns and because of the exiting challenge this project entails.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
				<p>We all have jobs or full time obligations so our aim is not to profit or create a means of living for ourselves in any way. We simply believe the majority of people want to fight deforestation, what is lacking is a platform that can push through a real collaborative impact. We want to establish this for free together with likeminded to create a powerful platform for change</p>
